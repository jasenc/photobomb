This is an Instagram clone application I started developing from Ben Walker's
[Dev Walks](http://www.devwalks.com/). I have successfully completed part 1, but
decided to take on some other projects to gain a better understanding of what
exactly Ruby on Rails is accomplishing instead of being lost in the magic.
I look forward to completing his series and returning to a Rails project now
that most things will not be foreign concepts to me.
